# Topological sorter
This library provides an implementation of a depth first sorting algorithm for directed acyclic 
graphs found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Depth-first_search):

    L ‚Üê Empty list that will contain the sorted nodes
    while there are unmarked nodes do
        select an unmarked node n
        visit(n)
        
        
    function visit(node n)
        if n has a permanent mark then return
        if n has a temporary mark then stop (not a DAG)
        mark n temporarily
        for each node m with an edge from n to m do
            visit(m)
        mark n permanently
        add n to head of L

## Usage

    List<MyNode> unsorted = ...
        
    List<MyNode> sorted = TopologicalSorter.sort(unsorted, new TopologicalSorter.EdgesFactory<MyNode>() {
        @Override
        public Collection<MyNode> getEdges(MyNode currentNode, Collection<MyNode> allNodes) {
            List<MyNode> edges = new ArrayList<>();
          
            // filter out the nodes connecting currentNode by going through all nodes in allNodes
          
            return edges;
        }
    });
