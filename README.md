# Topological sorter
This library provides an implementation of a depth first sorting algorithm for directed acyclic 
graphs found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Depth-first_search):

    L ‚Üê Empty list that will contain the sorted nodes
    while there are unmarked nodes do
        select an unmarked node n
        visit(n)
        
    function visit(node n)
        if n has a permanent mark then return
        if n has a temporary mark then stop (not a DAG)
        mark n temporarily
        for each node m with an edge from n to m do
            visit(m)
        mark n permanently
        add n to head of L

## Usage
Let's say we have a graph where a depends on b and c depends on both a and b.

Kotlin:

```kotlin
import net.daverix.topologicalsorter.graphOf
import net.daverix.topologicalsorter.sort

fun main() {
    val a = "A"
    val b = "B"
    val c = "C"
    
    val graph = graphOf(
        a to setOf(b),      // a depends on b
        c to setOf(a, b)    // c depends on a and b 
    )
    
    val sorted = graph.sort()
    
    println(sorted) // prints [B, A, C]
}
```

Java:

```java
class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String a = "A";
        String b = "B";
        String c = "C";
        
        Map<String, Set<String>> graph = new HashMap<String, Set<String>>();
        
        Set<String> dependenciesOfA = new HashSet<String>();
        dependenciesOfA.add(b);
        graph.put(a, dependenciesOfA);
        
        Set<String> dependenciesOfC = new HashSet<String>();
        dependenciesOfC.add(a);
        dependenciesOfC.add(b);
        graph.put(c, dependenciesOfC);
        
        List<String> sorted = TopologicalSorter.sort(graph);
        
        System.out.println(sorted); // prints [B, A, C]
    }
}
```
