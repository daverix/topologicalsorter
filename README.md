# Topological sorter
This library provides an implementation of a depth first sorting algorithm for directed acyclic 
graphs found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Depth-first_search):

    L ‚Üê Empty list that will contain the sorted nodes
    while there are unmarked nodes do
        select an unmarked node n
        visit(n)
        
        
    function visit(node n)
        if n has a permanent mark then return
        if n has a temporary mark then stop (not a DAG)
        mark n temporarily
        for each node m with an edge from n to m do
            visit(m)
        mark n permanently
        add n to head of L

## Usage

    MyNode myFirstNode = ...
    MyNode mySecondNode = ...
    MyNode myThirdNode = ...
    
    MutableGraph<MyNode> graph = new DirectedGraph<>();
    
    // add node without edges
    graph.add(myFirstNode);
    
    // add node with an edge to the first node
    graph.add(mySecondNode, myFirstNode);
    
    // add node with edges to first and second node
    graph.add(myThirdNode, myFirstNode, mySecondNode);
    
    List<MyNode> sorted = TopologicalSorter.sort(graph);

You can also make a lazy implementation by creating an implementation of Graph instead:

    public class MyCustomGraph<MyNode> implements Graph<MyNode> {
        private final Collection<MyNode> nodes;
        
        public MyCustomGraph(Collection<MyNode> nodes) {
            this.nodes = nodes;
        }
    
        @Override
        public Set<MyNode> getEdges(MyNode currentNode) {
            List<MyNode> edges = new ArrayList<>();
          
            // filter out the nodes connecting currentNode by going through the injected 
            // allNodes collection. For example, you could look at annotations. (see the unit 
            // tests for an example)
          
            return edges;
        }
        
        @Override
        public Iterator<MyService> iterator() {
            return allNodes.iterator();
        }
    }
    
And then use the class like this:

    List<MyNode> unsorted = asList(myFirstNode, mySecondNode, myThirdNode);
    List<MyNode> sorted = TopologicalSorter.sort(graph, new MyCustomGraph(nodes));
